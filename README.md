# FanMapGen

A fast, powerful, in-browser map generator that gives you fine-tuned control
over generation parameters. FanMapGen is intuitive enough for basic usage, but
grants users the opportunity to tweak generation to their liking.

Choose between different presets to fit your needs, or create your own with the
custom preset editor.

Built entirely in Vue with usage of perlin noise and HTML's canvas element.
